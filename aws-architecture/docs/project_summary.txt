This project is a cloud-native, AI-based Missing Child/Person Identification Network built using AWS services like Rekognition, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, SNS, DynamoDB, and Amazon Location Service. 
It allows users to upload images, which are then analyzed through Rekognition for face matching, alerts are triggered via SNS, and sightings are tracked using Location Service. 
The architecture includes a static frontend demo, a scalable serverless backend, NFC support, and secured data handling using IAM and KMS. 
This system is designed for NGOs, police, and emergency teams for real-time identification and rescue workflows.
